#TP2 Running instructions: load_tp2.py is the script for running a pretrained model and getting the sentence embeddings. train_tp2.py is the script for running a word2vec model trained by me to get sentence embeddings (you can use your own training corpus instead of the book urls used by me)

Run the code as usual with python (the python command on cmd) but substitute the path for T_sent file in variable sentenceFile for load_tp2.py and in variable inputSentenceFile for train_tp2.py as the path may differ on a different system
