#TP1

rawText.txt is the raw text (also available at https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/71950/pg71950.txt) T.txt is the target word file B.txt is the basis word file

To execute the code, run on command line as

$python tp1.py rawtextfilepath basisfilepath targetfilepath

(in case the command line procedure doesn't work I have put fallback input code in comments in the file)

This code will print out the 2 plot of words and the pairings of word as (targetWord, closestTargetWord)
