You can run fine_tp4.py as regular python file on the command line with language name (first letter in capital) as a sys argument

In case this file doesn't work, I have put a hardcoded version where all lines to be changed for each language are marked by a comment #changed for language
 
For English, I have used bert-base-uncased as pretrained model and for other languages, I have used bert-base-multilingual uncased

The compare_eval contains all the computed differences in various metrics
