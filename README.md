# NLPLabs
NLP Labs completed for the course TALN at UniGe
Each individual lab is referred to as TP (Travaux Pratique) and I have made folders corresponding to each one

TP1
tp1.py is a python script that does all the actions specified in the assignment. 

rawText.txt is the raw text (also available at https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/71950/pg71950.txt)
T.txt is the target word file
B.txt is the basis word file

To execute the code, run on command line as

$python tp1.py rawtextfilepath basisfilepath targetfilepath

(in case the command line procedure doesn't work I have put fallback input code in comments in the file)

This code will print out the 2 plot of words and the pairings of word as (targetWord, closestTargetWord)
